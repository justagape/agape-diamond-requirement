# Project: Refactoring and Modularity for new_code.html

## Objective
To refactor the existing example8.html into a modular TypeScript-based structure, ensuring that both the frontend and backend are correctly pointing to the respective URLs, and reorganize assets into appropriate directories for better maintainability and scalability. Additionally, refactor UI elements to be configurable rather than hard-coded.

## Task List
1. **Refactor HTML and JavaScript:**
   - Convert existing JavaScript code into TypeScript modules.
   - Ensure TypeScript code is compiled and bundled correctly.
2. **Reorganize Assets:**
   - Move existing folders (fonts, hdr, img, jquery, lib) into a new `assets` directory.
3. **Refactor UI Modules:**
   - Refactor UI elements to be configurable via a configuration file rather than hard-coded.
4. **Update HTML References:**
   - Update `new_code.html` to reference the new asset paths and TypeScript modules.
5. **Ensure Backend and Frontend Connectivity:**
   - Verify that the backend can correctly point to the frontend URL.
   - Ensure that the frontend is correctly pointing to the backend URL.
6. **Testing:**
   - Perform thorough testing to ensure the application works correctly after refactoring.
   - Ensure fonts, images, and other assets remain functional and compatible.
7. **Documentation:**
   - Document the new structure and configuration options.

## Deliverables
1. Refactored `new_code.html` file related files.
2. Modular TypeScript code.
3. Reorganized asset directories.
4. Configuration file for UI elements.
5. Updated and functional frontend-backend communication.
6. Documentation and code comments for clarity.

## Timeline

## Resources
- The existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- The `fonts`, `hdr`, `img`, `jquery`, and `lib` folders.
- A code editor or IDE.

## Notes
- Ensure that all new TypeScript code is well-documented.
- Maintain consistent coding styles and practices.
- Backup the existing code before making any changes.
- Use a configuration file to manage UI elements like background images, colors, and fonts to avoid hard-coding these values.

## File Contents Breakdown

- **new_code.html:** The main HTML file that imports the necessary modules.
- **bundle.js:** The JavaScript file that imports and exports necessary modules.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file that styles the HTML content.
- **fonts/, hdr/, img/, and lib/:** Folders containing static assets.
- **jquery/external/jquery/jquery.js** and **jquery/jquery-ui.min.js:** The jQuery and jQuery UI libraries.
- **modules/:** A folder containing separate modules for frontend and backend logic.
