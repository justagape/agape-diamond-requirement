# Project: Enhanced Frontend and Interaction Tracking for 3D Visualization

## Objective
To enhance the existing frontend codebase by ensuring full functionality of the 3D iframe features, converting HTML to robust TypeScript components, and developing a modular system for tracking user interactions like rotation and pinch within the iframe, with comprehensive data handling and transmission to Google Analytics.

## Task List

### Existing Feature Validation
1. **Validate Existing 3D Iframe Features:**
   - Confirm that the "Update Camera Setting," "Preload All," and "Take Picture" functionalities are fully operational and meet specified requirements.

### HTML to TypeScript Refactoring
2. **Refactor HTML to TypeScript:**
   - Continue conversion of `new_code.html` into modular TypeScript components.
   - Ensure type safety and scalability are maintained throughout the refactor.

### New Module Development for Interaction Tracking
3. **Develop Interaction Listener Module:**
   - Create a module within `interactionListener/` that detects specific user actions like zooming and rotating within the Three.js iframe.

4. **Develop Data Handler Module:**
   - Implement a module within `dataHandler/` that processes and formats interaction data received from the listener module.

5. **Enhance Google Analytics Integration:**
   - Update and enhance the module within `googleAnalytics/` to receive formatted data from the Data Handler and send it to Google Analytics using appropriate API methods.

## Deliverables
- Verified and fully functional existing 3D iframe features.
- Modular TypeScript components fully replacing the current `new_code.html`.
- Three modular components for interaction tracking:
  - **Interaction Listener Module:** For capturing user interactions.
  - **Data Handler Module:** For processing and formatting interaction data.
  - **Google Analytics Module:** For transmitting interaction data.
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guide for each module and overall project configuration.

## Timeline
- **By End of Day:**
  - Ensure full functionality of "Update Camera Setting," "Preload All," and "Take Picture."
  - Complete development of the Interaction Listener Module.
  - Initiate the development of the Data Handler Module.
  - Outline enhancements for the Google Analytics Module.
