# Project: Enhanced Frontend Interaction Tracking for 3D Visualization

## Objective
To improve user interaction tracking within the 3D iframe by developing a modular system that captures iframe interactions, processes the interaction data, and transmits it to Google Analytics.

## Task List
1. **Develop Interaction Listener Module:**
   - Create a module that listens for specific user actions like zooming and rotating within the Three.js iframe.

2. **Develop Data Handler Module:**
   - Implement a module that receives interaction data from the listener and formats it for transmission.

3. **Enhance Google Analytics Module:**
   - Update the existing Google Analytics module to receive formatted data from the handler and send it using the appropriate API methods.

## Deliverables
- Three modular components:
  - **Interaction Listener Module:** Captures and sends user interactions to the Data Handler.
  - **Data Handler Module:** Processes and formats data for Google Analytics transmission.
  - **Google Analytics Module:** Configured to receive and transmit interaction data to Google Analytics.
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guide for each module.

## Timeline
- **By End of Day:**
  - Design and implement the Interaction Listener Module.
  - Begin development on the Data Handler Module.
  - Sketch initial enhancements for the Google Analytics Module.

## Resources
- TypeScript Documentation: [TypeScript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- Three.js Documentation: [Three.js Docs](https://threejs.org/docs/)
- Google Analytics API: [Google Analytics Dev Guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics)

## Notes
- Ensure each module is independently testable and integrates seamlessly with the others.
- Compliance with data privacy and security standards must be ensured throughout the development process.
